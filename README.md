- Organize the repository better taking into account the other projects.
- Explain/present structure.

  TODO:
  - Theoretical explanation of VAE
  - Article following the code
       
Below is the result of interpolating in an artificially created dataset using **random normalizing flows**. The idea and part of the code is borrowed from the capstone project of tensorflow probability course.

To run it, install the requirements and run:

`python VAE/Data_generation.py && VAE/VAE.py && VAE/interpolation.py`
